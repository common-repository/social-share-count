Adds social sharing and link buttons to your posts, custom posts and pages, including facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Many More etc.

== Description ==

Social Share Count plugin adds a set of social buttons to your website, and includes social sites like Ravelry, Etsy, and Pinterest and other major social networks, including WhatsApp.  Support for sharing to WhatsApp is also provided on mobile devices.   You can choose from nine different button styles to match your theme.  You can have the share buttons automatically added to the top or bottom of each post, and can position the link buttons using either a widget, a shortcode or a template action hook.

You can use the share button and link button functions either separately, or together:

**Share Button mode** allows you to put a set of buttons at the top or bottom of each post.  Each button will share that post with that particular service.  I.e., clicking the facebook icon will open a window for the user to share your post on their Facebook page.  Not all services support sharing, for instance, you can't share via Etsy or Craftsy.

**Link Button mode** lets you configure the buttons to link directly you your profiles on the social networks.  I.e. clicking the facebook icon will take the user to your facebook page, clicking the Etsy icon will take them to your Etsy shop.   These are designed to be included in either your header, sidebars or footer, as they are not specific to a post.  These can be easily included by adding the Social Link Button widget to the area where you want the buttons to appear.
